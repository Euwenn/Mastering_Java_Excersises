    Fun project I did for personal friends. I will probably-
    not be sharing this with the world. So if you see this,
    you're awesome! :D
    --------------------------------------------------------

    This is a fun project I made for myself and friends to rank
    420 cartridges and (soon) various types of "flowers" etc ;).
    I will improve and add stuff slowly.
